* Terms
Saturation Current -> Dark Current, J_0. p-n ~10^-13; Schottky 10^-7 without organic barrier
Homojunctio -> As heterojunction, only with one material exclusively
Pirana is oxidative cleaning, does not involve HF but H2SO4! Similar method would be RCA; Asher gives similar result, but mybe less clean
* Zonly-Papers
0.1% to 0.5% seems to give the greatest increase. Zonyl increases surface smootheness and adherance, thereby suppressing edge-traps and improving FF. No effect on J and V. Donor-density seems to increase as well.
"Thus, the improvement of FF value by the 0.1% Zonyl treatment can be attributed to the lowerig of space charge layer at the c-Si/PEDOT:PSS interface." Liu, Applied Physics Letter (100), 2012
Their maximum was found at 0.5%, we use 0.2%, so I suggest a 0.0;0.2;0.4;0.5;0.6%
They used CLEVIOS1000

** Graphene Oxide (GO)
*** Method
PDOT:PSS:GO diluted in methanol then spin coated
Annealed at 200Â°C for 1h -> thickness was 55nm
Used 12.5% GO then 'optimised' - how?
*** Questions
What is RCA cleaned?
1:1:$ (?) NH4OH:H2O2:H2O (30 min.), the HCl:H2O2:H2O
